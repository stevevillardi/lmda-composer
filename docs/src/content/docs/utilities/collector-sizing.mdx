## Site Management

### Adding Sites

Each site represents a physical location or logical grouping of devices that will share collectors.

- Click **+** in the site list header to add a new site
- Sites are automatically named "Site 1", "Site 2", etc.
- Click on a site name to rename it
- Right-click or use the context menu to delete a site

### Site Tabs

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Devices" icon="server">
    Configure device counts by category. Each device type has:
    - **Count** — Number of devices
    - **Instances** — DataSource instances per device (configurable in settings)
    - **Methods** — Collection method weights (e.g., 80% Script, 20% SNMP)
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Logs" icon="document">
    Configure log ingestion sources:
    - **System Logs** — Firewalls, network devices, servers, etc.
    - **SNMP Traps** — Devices sending SNMP trap events
    - **NetFlow** — Network flow data from routers and switches
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Recommendations" icon="rocket">
    View calculated collector recommendations:
    - Polling collectors for device monitoring
    - Logs/Traps collectors for event ingestion
    - NetFlow collectors for flow data

### Device Count Cards

Each device category is displayed as a card with:
- Device type icon and name
- Count input field
- Instance count per device
- Collection method breakdown (when advanced details enabled)

### Advanced Details

Toggle **Details On** in the toolbar to show:
- Per-device instance counts
- Collection method percentages
- Total instances calculation

---

## Log & Flow Configuration

### System Logs

Configure log sources by selecting a log type and entering the device count:

| Log Type | Events/Second | Bytes/Event |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Firewalls | 1.0 | 300 |
| Network Devices | 0.75 | 150 |
| Linux Servers | 0.20 | 200 |
| Windows Servers | 0.20 | 200 |
| Load Balancers | 3.0 | 235 |
| IIS Web Servers | 6.20 | 2005 |
| vCenter | 1.75 | 300 |

### SNMP Traps

Configure devices sending SNMP traps with an estimated 0.01 events/second per device.

### NetFlow

Configure NetFlow-enabled devices:
- **Flows/Second** — Default 1,100 FPS per device
- **Bytes/Flow** — Used for ingestion estimates

---

## Recommendations

### Collector Sizes

The calculator recommends collectors from five size tiers:

| Size | vCPU | Memory | Disk | Max Load | Max EPS | Max FPS |
|------|------|--------|------|----------|---------|---------|
| <Badge text="SMALL" variant="note" /> | 1 | 2 GB | 35 GB | 21,286 | 200 | 7,800 |
| <Badge text="MEDIUM" variant="note" /> | 2 | 4 GB | 35 GB | 48,557 | 500 | 13,797 |
| <Badge text="LARGE" variant="note" /> | 4 | 8 GB | 35 GB | 104,714 | 2,500 | 23,166 |
| <Badge text="XL" variant="tip" /> | 8 | 16 GB | 35 GB | 165,950 | 4,000 | 37,418 |
| <Badge text="XXL" variant="tip" /> | 16 | 32 GB | 35 GB | 285,500 | 7,000 | 52,817 |

### Recommendation Cards

Each collector type displays:
- **Count** — Number of collectors needed
- **Size** — Recommended collector size
- **Utilization** — Load percentage with status indicator
- **Resource Requirements** — Total vCPU, Memory, and Disk

### Utilization Status

| Status | Utilization | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| <Badge text="Optimal" variant="success" /> | 0-70% | Healthy headroom for growth |
| <Badge text="Warning" variant="caution" /> | 70-85% | Consider capacity planning |
| <Badge text="Critical" variant="danger" /> | 85%+ | At or near capacity limits |

### Data Ingestion Estimates

The Recommendations tab shows estimated daily data ingestion:
- **Logs/Traps** — GB/day based on EPS and average event size
- **NetFlow** — GB/day range based on FPS and flow record size

---

## Settings

Access calculator settings via the **Settings** button in the toolbar.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Collector Load" icon="gauge">
    ### Max Load Percentage

    Target maximum utilization (50-100%). Lower values provide more headroom.

    ### Failover Configuration

    - **Polling Failover** — Add extra polling collector for HA
    - **Logs Failover** — Add extra log collector for HA

    ### Collector Capacities

    Customize capacity values (load, EPS, FPS) for each collector size.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Collection Methods" icon="network">
    Configure the relative CPU/resource cost of each polling method:

    | Method | Default Weight |
    |--------|----------------|
    | SNMPv2 | 1.0 |
    | HTTP | 1.1 |
    | JMX | 1.2 |
    | SNMPv3 | 1.3 |
    | JDBC | 1.5 |
    | WMI | 2.2 |
    | Perfmon | 3.0 |
    | WinRM | 4.0 |
    | Script | 5.0 |

    Higher weights indicate more resource-intensive methods.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Device Types" icon="server">
    Customize device type defaults:

    - **Base Instances** — Default DataSource instances per device
    - **Collection Methods** — Method distribution percentages
    - **Add Device Type** — Create custom device categories
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Forced Collector Size

Use the collector size selector in the toolbar to force all recommendations to use a specific size. Select "Auto" to let the calculator optimize automatically.

## Overview Panel

Click **Overview** in the site list header to see aggregated results across all sites:

- Total device count by category
- Combined collector requirements
- Total resource requirements (vCPU, Memory, Disk)
- Per-site breakdown with individual recommendations

---

## Best Practices

<Aside type="tip" title="Start Conservative">
  Begin with lower device counts and adjust upward. It's easier to add capacity than to over-provision.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Plan for Growth">
  Target 70% utilization to leave headroom for growth and unexpected spikes.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Verify Instance Counts">
  The default instance counts are averages. Your actual DataSource configuration may vary significantly based on enabled modules.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Persistent State">
  Your site configurations are automatically saved and will persist across sessions.
