## Installation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="How do I install?" icon="rocket">
    You can install from the Chrome Web Store, or load the extension manually in developer mode.

    <LinkCard
      title="Installation Guide"
      description="Detailed installation instructions."
      href="/lmda-composer/getting-started/installation/"
    />
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Why these permissions?" icon="setting">
    LMDA Composer requires permissions to:
    - **Access LogicMonitor tabs**: Use your existing session
    - **Store data locally**: Settings, history, drafts
    - **Access the file system**: Opening/saving files
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Multiple portals?" icon="list-format">
    **Yes!** Log into each portal in separate browser tabs, and LMDA Composer will detect all active sessions. Switch between portals using the Context dropdown.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## Script Execution

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Why can't I run my script?" icon="warning">
    Common reasons:
    - No portal selected
    - No collector selected
    - Collector is offline
    - Another execution is in progress

    <LinkCard
      title="Troubleshooting"
      description="Detailed solutions for common issues."
      href="/lmda-composer/reference/troubleshooting/"
    />
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Which collectors can I use?" icon="rocket">
    You can run scripts on any collector you have access to in LogicMonitor. The collector must be online and able to communicate with LogicMonitor.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Character limit?" icon="document">
    **Yes**, LogicMonitor has a 64,000 character limit for scripts. LMDA Composer shows a warning when you approach this limit.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="PowerShell on Linux?" icon="close">
    **No.** PowerShell scripts can only execute on Windows collectors. If you select a Linux collector with a PowerShell script, you'll see an error.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| <Badge text="Freeform" variant="default" /> | General scripting, no output validation |

## Editor

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Custom themes?" icon="sun">
    Currently, LMDA Composer supports System (auto), Light, and Dark themes. Custom themes are not yet supported.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Other languages?" icon="seti:groovy">
    **No.** LMDA Composer is specifically designed for LogicMonitor scripting, which uses Groovy and PowerShell.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Import VS Code settings?" icon="setting">
    Not currently. LMDA Composer has its own settings that can be configured in the Settings dialog.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Autocomplete?" icon="pencil">
    LMDA Composer doesn't currently provide LogicMonitor-specific autocomplete. Monaco provides basic language autocomplete for Groovy and PowerShell syntax.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Files and Saving

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Where are scripts saved?" icon="seti:folder">
    This depends on how you're working:
    - **Local files**: Saved to your computer's file system
    - **Module scripts**: Saved to LogicMonitor when you commit
    - **Drafts**: Automatically saved to browser storage
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Unsaved changes?" icon="warning">
    LMDA Composer auto-saves drafts. When you reopen, it offers to restore unsaved work. However, it's best practice to save regularly.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Sync across devices?" icon="rocket">
    LMDA Composer doesn't have built-in sync. You can:
    - Save files to cloud-synced folders (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
    - Use version control (Git)
    - Module scripts are synced via LogicMonitor
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## API Explorer

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Need API tokens?" icon="seti:json">
    **No!** Like script execution, the API Explorer uses your active browser session. No separate API credentials needed.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="What operations?" icon="list-format">
    You can perform any LogicMonitor API operation that your user account has permission for, including GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Rate limits?" icon="warning">
    **Yes**, LogicMonitor's standard API rate limits apply. You'll see a 429 error if you exceed limits.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## Module Management

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Create new modules?" icon="add-document">
    Currently, LMDA Composer is focused on editing existing modules. You can:
    - Import modules from LogicModule Exchange
    - Edit scripts in existing modules
    - Commit changes back to LogicMonitor

    Creating entirely new modules should be done in the LogicMonitor UI.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="What happens when I commit?" icon="approve-check-circle">
    When you commit:
    1. Your script changes are pushed to LogicMonitor
    2. Any staged metadata changes are applied
    3. A new version is created in module lineage
    4. The module is updated in production
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Revert to previous version?" icon="history">
    LogicMonitor doesn't support direct rollbacks. You can:
    1. View the previous version in Module Lineage
    2. Copy its content
    3. Commit as a new version
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Snippets and History

  <Card title="Share snippets with team?" icon="star">
    Snippets are stored locally in your browser. To share:
    - Export snippet content manually
    - Include in team documentation
    - Add to shared code repositories
  </Card>
  <Card title="How long is history kept?" icon="history">
    History is kept until you manually clear it, the configured limit is reached (oldest removed), or browser storage is cleared.
    
    Default limit is **50** entries, configurable in Settings.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Is my data secure?" icon="approve-check-circle">
    - Runs entirely in your browser
    - No data sent to third-party servers
    - All communication is with LogicMonitor using your session
    - Local storage is limited to your browser
  </Card>
  <Card title="Can others see my scripts?" icon="close">
