Module Lineage displays the release history of LogicMonitor's core modules, showing previous versions published to the Exchange.

## What Is Module Lineage?

<Aside type="caution" title="Important Distinction">
  Module Lineage shows **LogicMonitor's published module versions** from the Exchange—not a history of changes you've made to modules. There is currently no way to view previous versions of user modifications.
</Aside>

Lineage provides visibility into how LogicMonitor has updated and improved their core modules over time:

- **Exchange History** — View all versions LogicMonitor has published for a core module
- **Release Notes** — See what LogicMonitor changed in each release
- **Version Comparison** — Compare different Exchange releases side-by-side
- **Update Tracking** — Identify what's new in the latest Exchange version
- **Script Restoration** — Restore a historical version to your editor

---

## When Is Lineage Available?

Lineage is only available for **LogicMonitor core modules** that have been published to the Exchange. This includes:

- DataSources from the LogicMonitor Exchange
- ConfigSources, PropertySources, EventSources, and TopologySources from LM
- Any module with an Exchange-published history

<Aside type="note" title="Not Available For">
  - Custom modules you've created from scratch
  - Modules without Exchange history
  - Local files (not bound to a LogicModule)
</Aside>

## Lineage Dialog

### Version Selector

The dropdown at the top shows all Exchange versions:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Version** | LogicMonitor's release version number |
| **ID** | Unique locator identifier |
| **Date** | When LogicMonitor published this version |
| **Author** | Who published the version |

Versions are sorted newest first.

### Version Details

Select a version to see:
- LogicMonitor's release notes
- The script content from that version
- Side-by-side diff comparison with your current script

### Diff Viewer

The diff viewer shows changes between your current script and the selected historical version:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| <Badge text="+" variant="success" /> | Added lines (green background) |
| <Badge text="-" variant="danger" /> | Removed lines (red background) |
| Gray | Unchanged context |

## Restoring a Version

You can restore any historical version to your editor:

<Steps>

1. Open the Lineage dialog

2. Select the version you want to restore from the dropdown

3. Review the diff to understand what will change

4. Click **Restore** to replace your current script with the historical version

5. The script content is updated in your editor (not yet committed)

6. Review the changes and commit when ready

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip" title="Non-Destructive">
  Restoring a version only updates your editor content. You must still commit the changes to save them to LogicMonitor. If you change your mind, close the tab without committing.
</Aside>

## Use Cases

### Checking for Updates

Compare your current module version against the latest Exchange release to see what LogicMonitor has improved:

<Steps>

1. Open the module in LMDA Composer

2. View Lineage

3. Compare your version against the latest Exchange version

4. Decide whether to adopt the updates

</Steps>

### Understanding Exchange Changes

When LogicMonitor releases a new version, use Lineage to understand:
- What bugs were fixed
- What new features were added
- What breaking changes might affect your customizations

### Reference Implementation

If you've customized a module and need to see the "original" version:

<Steps>

1. Open Lineage for the module

2. Find the Exchange version your module was based on

3. View the original script content

4. Compare against your customizations

</Steps>

---

## Limitations

- **No User History** — Lineage does not track changes you make to modules. There's no way to view or revert to previous versions of your own edits.
- **Exchange Only** — Only modules with Exchange history have Lineage data. Custom modules created from scratch won't have Lineage.
- **Script-Level Only** — Lineage shows script content history, not metadata changes.

<Aside type="tip" title="Version Control for Your Changes">
  For tracking your own modifications, consider:
  - Exporting scripts to local files and using Git
  - Keeping notes of changes in module descriptions
  - Maintaining a changelog in your team's documentation
</Aside>

## Best Practices

- **Check Before Customizing** — Review the latest Exchange version before making changes to understand the current baseline
- **Track Your Baseline** — Note which Exchange version your customization is based on to simplify future comparisons
- **Review Updates Regularly** — Periodically check if LogicMonitor has released updates that might benefit your environment
- **Use Restore Carefully** — Remember that restoring replaces your entire script, so back up any custom changes first
