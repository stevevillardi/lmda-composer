Module Lineage shows the complete version history of a LogicModule, letting you track changes over time and compare versions.

## What Is Module Lineage?

Every time a LogicModule is modified and saved in LogicMonitor, a new version is created. Module Lineage provides:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Version History" icon="history">
    Chronological list of all module versions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Change Details" icon="document">
    See what changed in each version.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Diff Viewer" icon="seti:notebook">
    Compare any two versions side-by-side.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Author Tracking" icon="star">
    Who made each change and when.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Opening Lineage View

<CardGrid>

## Comparing Versions

### Side-by-Side Comparison

<Steps>

1. Select a version from the list

2. Click **Compare**

3. Choose the version to compare against

4. View the diff in the right panel

</Steps>

### Diff Viewer

The diff viewer shows changes with color coding:

<div style="display: grid; gap: 0.5rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 0.75rem;">
    <Badge text="+" variant="success" />
    <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Added lines (green background)</span>
  </div>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 0.75rem;">
    <Badge text="-" variant="danger" />
    <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Removed lines (red background)</span>
  </div>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 0.75rem;">
    <Badge text=" " variant="default" />
    <span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Unchanged context (gray)</span>
  </div>
</div>

### What's Compared

The diff includes:
- Script content changes
- Metadata modifications
- Configuration differences

## Understanding Version Numbers

### Version Format

LogicMonitor versions are numeric and sequential:

- **Version 1**: Initial module creation
- **Version 2**: First update
- **Version N**: Nth modification

### Version Gaps

Gaps in version numbers may indicate:
- Deleted intermediate versions
- Administrative actions
- Portal migrations

## Using Lineage for Troubleshooting

### Finding When a Bug Was Introduced

<Steps>

1. Identify when the bug started occurring

2. Open Module Lineage

3. Find versions around that timeframe

4. Compare working vs. broken versions

5. Identify the problematic change

</Steps>

### Reverting Changes

<Aside type="tip" title="Revert vs. Rollback">
  LogicMonitor doesn't support direct rollbacks. Create a new version with the old content instead:

  1. Find the desired version in lineage
  2. View its content
  3. Copy the script content
  4. Paste into the current editor
  5. Commit as a new version
</Aside>

## Best Practices

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Write Good Commit Messages" icon="pencil">
    Include what changed, why it changed, and any relevant ticket numbers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regular Reviews" icon="magnifier">
    Periodically review lineage to understand module evolution and identify unexpected changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Major Changes" icon="document">
    Note the "before" version and expected behavior changes for significant updates.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Author Information

### Who Made Changes

The author field shows:
- LogicMonitor username
- "System" for automated changes
- "LMDA Composer" for extension commits

### Tracking Contributors

Use lineage to identify module owners, find subject matter experts, and coordinate future changes.

## Integration with Workflow

### Before Making Changes

1. Check recent lineage entries
2. Understand current state
3. Note the current version number

### After Making Changes

1. View your new version in lineage
2. Verify changes appear correctly
3. Note version for team communication
