Module Lineage displays the release history of LogicMonitor's core modules, showing previous versions published to the Exchange.

## What Is Module Lineage?

<Aside type="caution" title="Important Distinction">
  Module Lineage shows **LogicMonitor's published module versions** from the Exchange—not a history of changes you've made to modules. There is currently no way to view previous versions of user modifications.
</Aside>

Lineage provides visibility into how LogicMonitor has updated and improved their core modules over time:

<CardGrid>
  <FeatureCard title="Exchange History" icon="history" color="blue">
    View all versions LogicMonitor has published for a core module.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Release Notes" icon="file-text" color="green">
    See what LogicMonitor changed in each release.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Version Comparison" icon="diff" color="purple">
    Compare different Exchange releases side-by-side.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Update Tracking" icon="refresh-cw" color="orange">
    Identify what's new in the latest Exchange version.
  </FeatureCard>
</CardGrid>

## When Is Lineage Available?

Lineage is only available for **LogicMonitor core modules** that have been published to the Exchange. This includes:

- DataSources from the LogicMonitor Exchange
- ConfigSources, PropertySources, EventSources, and TopologySources from LM
- Any module with an Exchange-published history

<Aside type="note" title="Not Available For">
  - Custom modules you've created from scratch
  - Modules without Exchange history
  - Local files (not bound to a LogicModule)
</Aside>

## Limitations

<CardGrid>
  <FeatureCard title="No User History" icon="x-circle" color="red">
    Lineage does not track changes you make to modules. There's no way to view or revert to previous versions of your own edits.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Exchange Only" icon="info" color="blue">
    Only modules with Exchange history have Lineage data. Custom modules created from scratch won't have Lineage.
  </FeatureCard>
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="Version Control for Your Changes">
  For tracking your own modifications, consider:
  - Exporting scripts to local files and using Git
  - Keeping notes of changes in module descriptions
  - Maintaining a changelog in your team's documentation
</Aside>

## Best Practices

    Note which Exchange version your customization is based on to simplify future comparisons.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Review Updates Regularly" icon="refresh-cw" color="blue">
